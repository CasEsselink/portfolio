# Learning Outcomes
In this file I will indicate where and how I have worked on the GP learning outcomes.

## Web application
*You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.*

*User friendly: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.*

*Full-stack: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.*

### 1. React
I learned to make and develop an React application. In our group project we used typescript as our language in React. We used it to make a shopping kart and I was mainly responseble for connecting the shopping kart to the restaurants staff tool.

### 2. API
As told earlier was I responseble for the connecting between the shopping kart and the restaurants staff tool. The two are connected with a Rest calls and websockets. Both are made in a springboot applictation using java.
