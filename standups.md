# Learning Outcomes
In this file I will indicate where and how I have worked on the GP learning outcomes.

## Web application
*You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.*

*User friendly: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.*

*Full-stack: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.*

### 1. React
I learned to make and develop an React application. In our group project we used typescript as our language in React. We used it to make a shopping kart and I was mainly responseble for connecting the shopping kart to the restaurants staff tool.

### 2. API
As told earlier was I responseble for the connecting between the shopping kart and the restaurants staff tool. The two are connected with a Rest calls and websockets. Both are made in a springboot applictation using java.

## Agile method
*You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.*

*Choose :You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.*

### 1. Jira board
In our group project we use jira to manage out project. In jira we keep track of our userstories and we log our time spent. Every sprint we choose the userstories and predict the time needed for them using story point poker.

Every day we have a standup and standdown. I am the scrum master for the second sprint. As scrum master I am responseble for a smooth standup and standdown. We log the information off this meeting in discord.
